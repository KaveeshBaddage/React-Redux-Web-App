### React Router

 React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with web application.React Router has been broken into three packages: 
    react-router, 
    react-router-dom,
    react-router-native.<br>
  There are <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter> components in React-router-dom. The <BrowserRouter> should be used when you have to handle dynamic requests (to respond to any possible URI), while the <HashRouter> should be used for static websites (can only respond to requests for files that it knows about). <br>
 Usually it is preferable to use a <BrowserRouter>, but if your website will be hosted on a server  and that only serves static files, then <HashRouter> is a good solution.

#### * Add  react-router-dom package
     react-router-dom --save
